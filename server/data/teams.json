A trumpet consists of a cylindrical tube, shaped in a primary oblong loop that flares into a bell. Modern\r\ntrumpets also have three piston valves as well as small, secondary tubing that act as tuning slides to adjust the tone.\r\nAlmost all trumpets played today are B-flat. This is the tone naturally played when the trumpet is blown. They have a\r\nrange between the F-sharp below middle C to two and a half octaves above (ending at B), and are comparatively easier to\r\nplay than other brass instruments.","Members":[{"MemberId":101,"Email":"LawsonBarnes@gmail.com","MemberName":"Lawson Barnes","ContactName":"Lawson Barnes","Age":21,"Gender":"Male","Phone":"555-521-8146"},{"MemberId":112,"Email":"corinne.a.trudeau@gmail.com","MemberName":"Sneha Hassan","ContactName":"Sneha Hassan","Age":20,"Gender":"Female","Phone":"860-917-2859"}]},{"TeamId":103,"TeamName":"Baritone","League":"LowBrass","ManagerName":"Ada Sutherland","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"AdaSutherland@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":30,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":80,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/section_photo_4.jpg","Description":"The baritone horn, or sometimes just called baritone, is a low-pitched brass instrument in the saxhorn family. It is a piston-valve brass instrument with a bore that is mostly conical (like the higher pitched flugelhorn and alto (tenor) horn) but it has a narrower bore than the similarly pitched euphonium. It uses a wide-rimmed cup mouthpiece like that of its peers, the trombone and euphonium. Like the trombone and the euphonium, the baritone horn can be considered either a transposing or non-transposing instrument.","Members":[{"MemberId":103,"Email":"HazelCurran@gmail.com","MemberName":"Hazel Curran","ContactName":"Hazel Curran","Age":20,"Gender":"Female","Phone":"555-521-1736"}]},{"TeamId":106,"TeamName":"Flute","League":"Woodwind","ManagerName":"Marlon Whitaker","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"MarlonWhitaker@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":5,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":100,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/section_photo_6.jpg","Description":"The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.","Members":[{"MemberId":107,"Email":"EarlLester@gmail.com","MemberName":"Earl Lester","ContactName":"Earl Lester","Age":21,"Gender":"Male","Phone":"555-521-1962"}]},{"TeamId":107,"TeamName":"Clarinet","League":"Woodwind","ManagerName":"Marcie Morrison","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"MarcieMorrisonr@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":10,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":100,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/section_photo_7.jpg","Description":"Clarinets have the largest pitch range of common woodwinds.[9] The intricate key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range is defined by the keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B♭ clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B♭ clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B♭ clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.","Members":[]},{"TeamId":108,"TeamName":"Saxophone","League":"Woodwind","ManagerName":"Guy Wilder","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"GuyWilder@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":15,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":100,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/section_photo_8.jpg","Description":"A saxophone is a single reed, woodwind instrument first developed in the mid-1800s by Adolphe Sax. It is composed of a mouthpiece, conical metal tube, and finger keys. Sound is produced when air is blown through the instrument causing the reed to vibrate. This sound is amplified as it travels through the instrument's main body. Saxophones consist of numerous parts and pieces which are made separately and then assembled.","Members":[{"MemberId":109,"Email":"HopeMunoz@gmail.com","MemberName":"Hope Munoz","ContactName":"Hope Munoz","Age":18,"Gender":"Male","Phone":"555-521-1746"}]},{"TeamId":109,"TeamName":"Drumline","League":"Percussion","ManagerName":"Kaci Parkinson","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"KaciParkinson@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":50,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":35,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/section_photo_9.jpg","Description":"The batterie drumline is a section that marches on the field as a group. The batterie usually consists of snare drums, bass drums, tenor drums, and cymbals.[2] In the past, marching timpani were common before the adoption of the front ensemble, as were marching keyboard percussion instruments such as glockenspiels and xylophones. A relatively small number of bands, mostly at the college level, continue to field such traditional marching keyboard instruments; however, most bands have phased out their use.","Members":[{"MemberId":110,"Email":"AbigailBonillaz@gmail.com","MemberName":"Abigail Bonilla","ContactName":"Abigail Bonilla","Age":21,"Gender":"Female","Phone":"555-521-1746"}]},{"TeamId":111,"TeamName":"test","League":"LowBrass","ManagerName":"Aliza Barlow","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"AlizaBarlow@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":70,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":35,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/default_photo.png","Description":"DSFASDF","Members":[]},{"TeamId":112,"TeamName":"test","League":"Auxiliary","ManagerName":"Aliza Barlow","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"AlizaBarlow@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":70,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":35,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/default_photo.png","Description":"DSFASDF","Members":[]},{"TeamId":113,"TeamName":"test","League":"Woodwind","ManagerName":"Aliza Barlow","ManagerPhone":"555-521-8158","ManagerEmail":"AlizaBarlow@gmail.com","MaxTeamMembers":70,"MinMemberAge":17,"MaxMemberAge":35,"TeamGender":"Any","Picture":"images/section_photos/default_photo.png","Description":"DSFASDF","Members":[]}]
